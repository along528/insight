You will have to specify the path of the downloaded dataset
The dataset is provided as a tab-separated-value (.tsv) format along with some others.
The script tsv_to_csv.py does the proper conversion to the .csv format.

You can build the database assuming you have the data by using
police_bjs_build.ipynb

Then start postgresql database using
psql police_bjs -h localhost -U along528

There is just one table:
police_data_table
