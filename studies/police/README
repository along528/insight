Relies on data from here:

You will have to specify the path of the downloaded dataset
The dataset is provided as a tab-separated-value (.tsv) format along with some others.
I tried to convert this myself but that failed miserably for some reason.
The best way seems to be to open the tsv in LibreOffice, use just tab delimiters and then save as a .csv.
The script tsv_to_csv.py tries do to do the the proper conversion to the .csv format but fails

You can build the database assuming you have the data by using
police_bjs_build.ipynb

Then start postgresql database using
psql police_bjs -h localhost -U along528

There is just one table:
police_data_table
